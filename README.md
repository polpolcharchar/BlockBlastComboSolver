# BlockBlastComboSolver
A Block Blast solver that maintains a combo

To begin:
- Click or drag on the left grid to copy your game state
- For each piece that needs to be placed, draw it on the right grid and click 'Add Piece'
- Click 'Load Sequence'
- The best move will be highlighted yellow. Place this piece in your game, and then click 'Step Sequence'. Repeat for all pieces

Notes:
- For the IOS version of Block Blast, staying alive is **NOT** guarenteed
- The solver is quick for three or less pieces. For more pieces than this, it takes an increasingly long amount of time
- To remove an added piece (in red), click it
